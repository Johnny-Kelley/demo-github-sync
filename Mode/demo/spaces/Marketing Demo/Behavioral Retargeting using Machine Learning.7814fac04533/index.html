        <p><br></p>
        <p>In order to optimize our marketing budget for the rest of the year, we'll have to not only change our Adwords messaging, but will also have to revisit the profile of individuals we have been targeting. Towards that end, we've built a Machine Learning
          model that identifies the following variables to be the best predictors of whether an Ad viewer will signup or not:</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Number of employees</em>: We should target users who work companies with less than 5k employees</li>
          <li>We should keep a gap of <em>at least 16 days</em> between targeting a user again from a previous campaign to the next</li>
          <li>Users that visit our website spend <em>less than 172</em> seconds since the time they land on our website. This is crucial because we only have approximately 3 minutes of their attention span to make them Sign up, after which the likelihood
            of them doing so decreases drastically</li>
        </ul>
