        <p><br></p>
        <p>In order to determine membership for our loyalty progams, we should first analyze which accounts are most likely to place an order via our ecommerce program. Those that are most likely to order beer should be placed in our "gold" loyalty tier,
          where they will be invited to take part of promotional campaigns and to receive discounts on future purchases.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>Other accounts that are fairly likely to place orders should be placed in our "silver" loyalty tier, whereas those that are somwhat likely to place orders should be placed in our "bronze" tier. This analysis highlights the variables most likely
          to relate to purchasing behavior within one month of receiving a targeted email message from ABI to sign up for the ecommerce platform:</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Account state population: We should target accounts based in states with a total population less than 5,000,000 residents</li>
          <li>Account age months: We should target accounts that have had a relationship with ABI that is less than or equal to 16 total months</li>
          <li>Duration: We should target accounts that spend more than three minutes on our website</li>
        </ul>
